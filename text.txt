	PROJECT DESCRIPTION

	Data preparation: Imported Verilog netlist, Read SDC,TECH Files,LEF and libraries
	Perform Sanity Checks
	Floorplan: Used source file for IO Port locations and Boundary. Provided core to IO boundary, Placed Macros and fixed Macros and IO ports. Derived PG Connection, created power straps for nets VDD, VSS and pre-route standard cell rails, performed Cut rows near Macros, added End-Cap cells, Tap cells and set attribute fixed, Created placement blockages
	Placement: Inserted buffers for all IO ports. Created placement and legalized placement and Verified GRC, Cell Density, Pin Density, Module Placement, Placement Utilization. Congestion reports & Timing reports are done, Pre-CTS optimization
	CTS: Defined the Routing rules width and spacing, applied routing rule to clock nets, performed timing optimization, CTO buffers used for optimization
	Routing: Defined Routing layers, Global route, Track assignment, Detailed route, Route Optimization. Verified Congestion, Timing and  QoR.
	Performed DRC Fixes (Shorts & Opens)
